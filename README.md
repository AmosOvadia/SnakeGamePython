# SnakeGamePython
- Developed a classic Snake Game using Python, incorporating both Tkinter and Pygame libraries for graphical interface and game logic, respectively.
- Implemented core game features like controlling the snake's movement using arrow keys, tracking the player's score, and ending the game upon collision with the snake itself or the game boundaries.
- Utilized Tkinter for GUI elements and Pygame to control background music seamlessly during gameplay.
- Followed the game development process from start to finish, handling features such as directing the snake's movement, managing collisions, scoring systems, and integrating music.
- The project demonstrates proficiency in Python and its libraries, experience in graphical user interface development, and familiarity with game logic implementations.
- Skills showcased include creativity in problem-solving, ability to tackle challenges, and self-learning in completing the entire game development process.
